# 3D Demos by Max Godefroy

This project is meant for me to be a way to experiment with OpenGL.

## Current Status

Most of the basic common structure of the code is done, and I'm 
currently focusing on the Sphere project

More specifically, right now, I'm working on:
- Loading and applying a displacement map texture to an object
- Fragment shader support of parallax mapping


## Individual projects

More projects might be coming down the road, and some may currently be 
on hold. Please refer to the current status section for more information
on which projects are currently being worked on
