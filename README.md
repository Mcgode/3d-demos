# Kryne Engine by Max Godefroy

Starting as just a way to experiment with OpenGL, this project has 
finally ended up looking more and more like an engine (albeit a 
rudimentary one).
As such, I'll be continuing to work on it to make it more functional, 
with the end goal of being able to have a basic game run on it.

## Current Status

The code structure and the pipeline are currently having an overhaul.

More specifically, right now, I'm working on:
- Restructure engine code, to improve current pipeline and have one similar to [three.js](https://threejs.org))
- Switch to smart pointers


## Examples

Examples are smaller projects I'm using to experiment with graphics.

More projects might be coming down the road, and some may currently be 
on hold. Please refer to the current status section for more information
on which projects are currently being worked on.
