# 3D Demos by Max Godefroy

This project is meant for me to be a way to experiment with OpenGL.

## Current Status

Most of the basic common structure of the code is done.
I've put the Sphere project on hold, and I'm working on the SunLight project

More specifically, right now, I'm working on:
- Loading a model from a file (with Assimp)
- Setting up the SunLight scene

## Individual projects

More projects might be coming down the road, and some may currently be 
on hold. Please refer to the current status section for more information
on which projects are currently being worked on

### Sphere

Goal : Experimenting texture mapping effects on a sphere

- [ ] (*ON HOLD*) parallax mapping
- [ ] displacement mapping


### SunLight

Goal : Rendering an open scene with multiple light effects
- [ ] (*WIP*) basic lighting and scene setup
- [ ] shadow mapping
- [ ] cascaded shadow mapping
- [ ] transparency support for shadow mapping
- [ ] soft shadow mapping
- [ ] HDR (high dynamic range) and tone mapping
- [ ] bloom
- [ ] lens flare
- [ ] SAO (scalable ambient obscurance) implementation
