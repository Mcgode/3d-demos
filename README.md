# 3D Demos by Max Godefroy

This project is meant for me to be a way to experiment with OpenGL.

## Current Status

I am still working on implementing a basic common structure on many 
recurring aspects of the code, like object handling. As such, I haven't 
progressed much on the individual projects.

More specifically, right now, I'm working on:
- Support for texture import from file
- Apply texture on draw
- Setting up of objects supporting textures
- Fragment shader support for textures


## Individual projects

More projects might be coming down the road, and some may currently be 
on hold. Please refer to the current status section for more information
on which projects are currently being worked on
