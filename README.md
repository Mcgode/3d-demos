# Kryne Engine by Max Godefroy

Starting as just a way to experiment with OpenGL, this project has 
finally ended up looking more and more like an engine (albeit a 
rudimentary one).
As such, I'll be continuing to work on it to make it more functional, 
with the end goal of being able to have a basic game run on it.

## Current Status

Most of the basic common structure of the code is done.
I've put the Sphere project on hold, and I'm working on the SunLight 
project.

More specifically, right now, I'm working on:
- Implementing a cascaded shadow maps process
- Renaming the project assets to match the new name 

## Individual projects

More projects might be coming down the road, and some may currently be 
on hold. Please refer to the current status section for more information
on which projects are currently being worked on.
